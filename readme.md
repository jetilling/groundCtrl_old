# GroundCtrl

_Keep tabs on all of your projects_

This project is currently built for local use on an individual computer. The app is started view docker-compose and viewed in the browser. It started as a way for me to learn Elm and to keep track of all my browser tabs, but slowly grew into a toolkit for my daily and weekly tasks. 

Next I plan to work on adding a Notes section in Elm, where users (I) can save notes on each project.

## Setup

[Instructions for setting up the project can be found in this wiki](https://github.com/jetilling/groundCtrl/wiki/Setup-For-Local-Development)

## Screenshots

[Here are a few screenshots of the app](https://github.com/jetilling/groundCtrl/issues/4)
